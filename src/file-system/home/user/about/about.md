# Hi there

My name is Eshwar Vijay. I work with AI and DevOps - basically I make systems intelligent and make sure they don't crash at 3 AM.

I don't do machine learning, but I do teach machines how to behave in production.

I travel when I can because changing time zones is easier than fixing bugs at midnight.

Type "cd ~/projects" then "ls" to see some of the projects I've built.
